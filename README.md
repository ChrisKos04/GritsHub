# **GritsHub**

*GritsHub* is an innovative platform that we will be developing as both an app 📱 and a website 🌐, designed to connect verified low-income individuals with local businesses that have surplus food 🍞🥦 to donate. Verified users—initially through government-issued assistance programs like EBT/Food Stamps 💳—will be able to reserve excess food from grocery stores 🛒, restaurants 🍕, candy stores 🍬, and other edible businesses 🍽️ that would otherwise go to waste. The aim is to alleviate food insecurity 🍽️ by providing a dignified and convenient way for individuals to access food during tight weeks 💸 while also reducing the strain on food pantries and fighting food waste ♻️.

*GritsHub* is not intended to be a primary food source 🍴 but rather a supplemental service to help individuals during difficult times ⏳, ensuring access to quality food 🥗. The platform will also enable businesses to easily donate surplus food and track their environmental impact 🌍. In the future, we plan to expand to include low-income individuals who may not qualify for government aid but still face food insecurity, creating a more inclusive 🤝 and sustainable food-sharing ecosystem 🌱.
