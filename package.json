  "description": "*GritsHub* is an innovative platform that we will be developing as both an app 📱 and a website 🌐, designed to connect verified low-income individuals with local businesses that have surplus food 🍞🥦 to donate. Verified users—initially through government-issued assistance programs like EBT/Food Stamps 💳—will be able to reserve excess food from grocery stores 🛒, restaurants 🍕, candy stores 🍬, and other edible businesses 🍽️ that would otherwise go to waste. The aim is to alleviate food insecurity 🍽️ by providing a dignified and convenient way for individuals to access food during tight weeks 💸 while also reducing the strain on food pantries and fighting food waste ♻️.",
